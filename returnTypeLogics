Return Type Logics:

Program.each_line do |line|

# If found new function
If function declaration found:
	
	# If there was no space between previous
	# function and this one
	If in_function == true:
		parse_for_type(prev_line)
	
	in_function = true

# If last (line was not first in program)
# and (last line was inside function)
# and (now stepping outside of function)
If prev_line != nil and in_function == true and #tabs_at_start(line) == 0:
	parse_for_type(prev_line)
	in_function = false

# If line is empty
If line.strip.length == 0:
	next

If declaration_found(line):
	Add declaration of variable(s) to Current Function Hash

parse_for_type: Looks at line, Current Vars Hash, and built Functions Hash
to try and determine the type of the returned value.

If last value is var (or var = ...)
	Return type of var whether known or T-x
	If var = f(x):
		Return [return type of f(x)]
	(If it is known, good. If not inferred or declared, arbitrary.
	 If needs another function, we'll fill it in later.)
