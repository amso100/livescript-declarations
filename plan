Plan:
- Assumption: The __global__ scope comes last, and functions come in same order as ast
- Assumption: Only one nested scope.

Create "basic" typegraph that contains subtype relations for user-defined classes.

Go over all variables in the program, by the order in which they appear in the get_vars output.
- In parallel, go over all variables in decls, by scope.
	For variable x: get_vars[x] <: decls[x]
